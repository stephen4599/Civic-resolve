# Welcome to CivicResolve 🤝

**Empowering Communities to Build Better Cities.**

Hi there! Welcome to the repository for **CivicResolve**.

We believe that great neighborhoods start with engaged citizens. Yet, reporting simple issues like a broken streetlight or a pothole can often feel complicated or unresponsive. **CivicResolve** changes that.

It's a comprehensive platform built to bridge the gap between residents and local authorities. We make it incredibly easy for people to report issues (pinpointing them exactly on a map 📍) and just as easy for authorities to track, assign, and resolve them.
