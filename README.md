Welcome to CivicResolve 🤝
Empowering Communities to Build Better Cities.

Hi there! Welcome to the repository for CivicResolve.

We believe that great neighborhoods start with engaged citizens. Yet, reporting simple issues like a broken streetlight or a pothole can often feel complicated or unresponsive. CivicResolve changes that.

It's a comprehensive platform built to bridge the gap between residents and local authorities. We make it incredibly easy for people to report issues (pinpointing them exactly on a map 📍) and just as easy for authorities to track, assign, and resolve them.

🚀 What's Under the Hood?
We've built this using a robust, modern stack to ensure it's fast, reliable, and secure.

The Brains (Backend) 🧠
Java 21 & Spring Boot 3: For a solid, high-performance foundation.
Spring Data JPA (Hibernate): For efficient database interactions.
Spring Security & JWT: To ensure secure, stateless authentication.
Java Mail Sender: For sending welcome emails, status updates, and password reset links.
MySQL: To keep all our data organized and safe.
The Face (Frontend) 🎨
React (Vite): For a snappy, smooth user experience.
React Bootstrap: For a responsive, clean UI.
Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions.
Leaflet & React-Leaflet: For interactive maps and clustering.
Chart.js: For visualizing administrative data.
